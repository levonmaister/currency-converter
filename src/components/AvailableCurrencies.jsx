/*
TASK4: (10p)

Now it's time to utilize all your learnings and do some independent work!

Create a component that gets all the currencies and symbols from the API
and renders them. It's also wise, but not mandatory to do 
ListComponent and ItemComponent separately if needed. You can create
it on a separate file.

Feel free to use any display format that you would like. 
However we recommend to use some kind of tabular format. 
Maybe even CSS grid? However flexbox is more than enought
to present the data. 

Put CSS in use and remember "className" instead of "class"!
You can also do inline-css here if you want.

Take note how we're utilizing API on other components. Blatant
copy-paste would be almost enough if you know what you're doing. 

Remember to ask help if you get stuck!
